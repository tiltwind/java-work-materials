The Diagnostic Tool Framework for Java (DTFJ) is a Java application programming interface (API) used to support the building of Java diagnostics tools.

------------------------
	IBM DTFJ overview
	DTFJ works with data from a system dump that has been processed by the jextract tool. 
	The jextract tool produces metadata from the dump, which allows the internal structure of the JVM to be analyzed. 
	You must run jextract on the system that produced the dump. (For more information on jextract see the Diagnosis documentation.)
	The DTFJ API helps diagnostics tools access the following information:
		> Memory locations stored in the dump
		> Relationships between memory locations and Java internals
		> Java threads running within the JVM
		> Native threads held in the dump
		> Java classes and their classloaders that were present
		> Java objects that were present in the heap
		> Java monitors and the objects and threads they are associated with
		> Details of the machine on which the dump was produced
		> Details of the Java version that was being used
		> The command line that launched the JVM
