Oracle/Sun Java offers internal cache for it's own name resolution mechanism (it is not specific to Apache Tomcat servlet container).

It seems that easiest solution would be restart whole JVM container. 
Later, if you want to completely disable internal DNS cache, 
you can do this by setting "networkaddress.cache.ttl" and "networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl" system properties to 0.

networkaddress.cache.ttl
Specified in java.security to indicate the caching policy for successful name lookups from the name service.. 
The value is specified as as integer to indicate the number of seconds to cache the successful lookup.
A value of -1 indicates "cache forever". The default behavior is to cache forever when a security manager is installed, 
and to cache for an implementation specific period of time, when a security manager is not installed.


networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl (default: 10)
Specified in java.security to indicate the caching policy for un-successful name lookups from the name service.. 
The value is specified as as integer to indicate the number of seconds to cache the failure for un-successful lookups.
A value of 0 indicates "never cache". A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".
